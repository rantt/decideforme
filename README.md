# DecideForMe

Based on the [Creating a Roulette Wheel Using HTML5 Canvas](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1008/creating-a-roulette-wheel-using-html5-canvas) tutorial.


This version generates a spinning wheel to choose and option from a comma-separated list.  Items are shuffled before being added to the wheel.  Sizing changes dynamically fit the items and colourize the wheel appropriately.

Examples:

[Pick a Number between 1 and 20](http://divideby5.com/decideforme/?1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)

[Pick a Pizza Place](http://198.211.105.87/decideforme/?Boston Pizza, Luna's, Dominos, Super Store, Pizza Hut, East Side Marios, Greco, Papa Johns, New England Pizza Co., Pizza Twice, Pizza Delight, Panago, Little Ceasers, Jesse's Pizza)
